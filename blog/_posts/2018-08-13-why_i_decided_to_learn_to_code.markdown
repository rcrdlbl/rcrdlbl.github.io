The practical reasons I made this choice are:
* Income
* There seems to be a great flexibility of working arrangements within this field
* The best learning style for coding (or at least the one flatiron school seems to be recommending) involves piecing together samples of documentation, learning something new before you've mastered what came before, in a way that you master the simpler concepts without noticing it, which aligns with the way I learn.

I also made this decision because from my experience programming appears to be a combination of engineering, lawmaking and architecture; a game in which you create and restrict flows of data and interactions in order to synthesize new behaviors in reality. Finishing this post with a more "poetic" version of the previous paragraph, taken from the CCRU archives:

> All code-process is military manoeuve: constrictions and escapes, intelligence collection, disinformation, mapping, virus.
Truth and falsity are derivative factors, and strictly technical, in relation to the primary and secondary features of alignment and orientation. 
Strategic power consolidation, tactical melting into the jungle.
