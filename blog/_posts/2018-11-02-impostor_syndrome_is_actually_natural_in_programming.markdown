While most sources you view online present impostor syndrome as a massive issue facing the tech field today, I believe that impostor syndrome affects close to 100% of programmers today, as the never-ending learning process for computer programmers involves managing the stress of continual acclimation to new symbolic others.

Due to the inherent disconnect between your thought processes and the abstraction structures that a computer runs on, programming requires constant internal translation between arbitrary (to your biology at least) code and your internal monologue, as well as constantly simulating the machine that you are building within your head.

This is where impostor syndrome tends to set in. Because in plain language, your brain's description of the task you are trying to make the computer perform is usually only one or two sentences long, while what you see on the screen is far more complex than that, and what happens on silicon outside of the text files you are working on is impossible for 99% of human beings to watch play out in their heads, you feel stress as your mind thinks you're "cheating" and "don't know what you're talking about". This is true, but if it makes you feel any better, this is also true for literally every programmer. Of course with experience you can switch between these levels of abstraction, it's incredibly rare that you'll actually "know what you're doing". This is okay though! You shouldn't beat yourself up over this because the shakiness comes with the territory. If you're not a little confused when you take a step back and look it all over, chances are you aren't really doing anything interesting.

While of course individual life circumstances and personality can amplify these feelings of frustration, and being "the least experienced person in the room" or "the only _____ in the room" takes courage, i hope more of us can find comfort in knowing that you are never the only person in the room who doesn't completely understand what's going on.
